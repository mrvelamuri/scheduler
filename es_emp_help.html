Welcome to the Employee Scheduler Tutorial.  This tutorial will guide you through setting up and working with the online Employee Scheduler.  You may return to this tutorial at any time by clicking on the 
"Help" link in the upper right hand corner of the page.<br><br>

<hr>
<br><b>Introduction</b><br><br>
The online Employee Scheduler is a tool that helps speed up the scheduling process and streamlines the dissemination of schedule information to employees.  <br><br>

As an Employee, you may login to the system and enter the hours you would prefer to work.  There are three preference levels.  A preference level of 3 means you really want to work at that time. 
A preference level of 1 means you are available to work that time if necessary.  Your schedule is then available to your supervisors.  
They may assign you to work positions from the available hours you entered in.<br><br>

After you have been scheduled to work positions, you will be able to view the schedule for those positions from the "My Positions" menu item.<br><br>
You will also be able to view the work schedule and availability schedule of your colleagues who are assigned to the same positions as you are.  This is made available through the "My Colleagues" menu.  This menu 
can help you find a colleague to work for you in the event you need a substitute.<br><br>

<br><b>Editing Your Schedule</b><br><br>
When you first login to the system you will be prompted to begin creating your schedule.  After you have saved your schedule, you may return to the edit schedule area, by clicking on the "My Schedule" link and 
then pressing the "Edit Schedule" button on the bottom of the page.<br><br>

On the "Edit Schedule" page, you will find a list of color-coded options.  You edit your schedule by selecting from the list of items and then clicking on a box in your schedule grid below.  All time slots default 
to "Unavailable". Mark the times you are available to work by selecting a preference level and then clicking a box in the schedule.<br><br>

If you have marked a time with a preference level, and would like to make that time slot unavailable again, then select the "Unavailable" option and click on the desired time slot.<br><br>

Your supervisor may want to you to include your class shedule. You may enter your classes by selecting the "Course" color and clicking on a box in the schedule and filling in the required information. 
To remove a course from your schedule, select the remove link next to that schedule.<br><br>

You may also make a comment for your supervisor about a particular hour, by selecting the "Comment" color and clicking on a box in the schedule. To remove a comment, select the remove link next to that comment.<br><br>

When your supervisor schedules you to work at a time slot, that slot will become white with the name of the position you are scheduled to work. You must contact your supervisor to make changes 
to a time slot for which you have already been scheduled to work.<br><br>

To the right are the hourly guidelines setup by you and your supervisor.  You may set the number of hours you would like to work from the "My Information" area.  The maximum and minimum hours are
set by your supervisor and are a guide to you as you make your schedule.  The other numbers will adjust as you begin marking preference levels on your schedule.<br><br>

When you have finished editing your schedule, click on the "Save Schedule" button.  You may notify your supervisor that you have finished editing your schedule by checking the box marked "Email my supervisors."  
This will send an email to your supervisor informing them that you have made a change to your schedule and that they can begin scheduling you to work.<br><br>

<hr>
<br><b>Editing Your Personal Information</b><br><br>
Clicking on the "My Information" link will take you to a form where you may enter your personal contact information.  From this form you can change how your name is displayed, and the phone numbers and email where
your supervisors and colleagues may contact you.  The notes field will only be viewable by you and your supervisor.<br><br>
By providing an accurate email address, your supervisor can send you updates whenever she changes the schedule and can contact you via email if there are any scheduling problems.<br><br>
You can change your picture using the Upload Picture section of the form.  This picture will appear next to your name on all lists within the system.<br><br>
