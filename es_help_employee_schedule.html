<br><br><b>Employee Schedules</b><br><br>
You can view or edit an employee's schedule by going to the <a href="es_sup_employees.php">Employee List</a> section and clicking on the "view schedule" to the right of the employee's name.<br><br>
This screen shows you the employee's schedule as they see it.  You can edit the schedule by clicking on the "Edit Schedule" button at the bottom of the page.  From the employee edit schedule page
you have the same options as the employees for editing their schedule.  You also have the option of assigning them to work certain positions.<br><br>

Assign them to positions by choosing the position schedule from the "Assign to Position" drop down list.  Then hit the "Change Position Schedule" button.  If you would like to see the position's
schedule along with the employee's schedule, then also check the "Show this schedule" checkbox.  All of the position assignments for this position schedule will appear in the boxes under the employee's schedule
in the same color text as the background of the "Assign to Position" box.  You can schedule employees to work during a position schedule by select the "Assign to Position" option and then selecting a box 
on the schedule grid.<br><br>

You may remove a position assignment by selecting the "Unavailable" option and clicking over the assignment you want to remove.  You may change the position/schedule for which they are scheduled to work by selecting a 
different schedule name in the drop down list and then selecting the same box again.<br><br>
