<br><br><b>My Schedule</b><br><br>
You will use your "My Schedule" area to create your own schedule, so that you or other supervisors you are assigned to can schedule you to work on a position's schedule.<br><br>

By clicking on the <a href="es_emp_index.php">My Schedule</a> link in the left-hand menubar, you will be taken to a page where you can view your schedule.  This page shows you 
what areas you have marked as available for work and their preference level.  It also shows you any comments you made on your schedule and any courses you entered in.  If you have
been scheduled to work any positions, the hours that you have been scheduled will have the position name in the box.  If you have been assigned to work a position with a rotating 
schedule, the next date you are required to work will be printed under the position name.<br><br>

Above your schedule is a list showing your schedule parameters.  It lists your minimum available hours, maximum available hours, total hours you have available, total desired 
working hours, and the total hours you are scheduled to work.  There are also links to show your schedule in a 24 hour view or to show weekends.<br><br>

To edit your schedule, click on the "Edit Schedule" button at the bottom of the page.  From the edit schedule page, you can select an option from the list above your schedule and then click 
on a square in your schedule to mark it.  As you place prefered hours, the list showing your totals will automatically adjust to show how many more hours you need to meet your maximums and 
minimums.<br><br>

You will not be allowed to change any hour that you have already been scheduled to work from this screen.  To change a scheduled hour use the "Areas &amp; Positions" menu, 
or the "Employees" menu.<br><br>
